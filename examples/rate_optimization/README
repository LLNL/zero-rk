Zero-RK Rate Optimization

This examples is intended to confirm that the rate optimization
code is working and to show the basic features.  The example 
creates an artificially modified hydrogen reaction model and
uses evolutionary search methods to try to match the original
model.  In practice, this code is intended to be used to  modify
a reduced mechanism to match ignition delay or perfectly stirred
reactor predictions from a detailed model.  See the comments in
optimize_rate_h2_simple.py for details on some of the settings.
