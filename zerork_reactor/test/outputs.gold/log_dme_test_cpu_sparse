INFO: Reaction 1 may not have the intended centering function.
      Troe centering fucntion Fc(T) being used:
        Fc(T) = (1)exp(-T/(1e-15))
                +(0)exp(-T/(1e-15))
                +exp(-40/T)

      In some older mechanisms, non-positive parameters were
      sometimes used as flags for alternative forms for the
      centering function Fc.  Please verify that the above
      definition is consistent with your expectations.
INFO: Reaction 15 may not have the intended centering function.
      Troe centering fucntion Fc(T) being used:
        Fc(T) = (0)exp(-T/(1e-15))
                +(1)exp(-T/(95))
